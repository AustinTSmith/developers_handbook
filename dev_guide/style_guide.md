# Spartronics Programming Style Guide

Consistent and aggressively enforced code style helps reduce errors and conflicting code.

## Code Formatting

@TODO - do we still have this? can we do this with vs code?


Pinned to the `#programming` Slack channel is a file called `Code Formatting.zip`.

Download that, unzip it, then open Eclipse.

Go to `Window` &rarr; `Preferences` &rarr; `Java` &rarr; `Code Style`

For each of:

- "Clean Up"
- "Formatter"
- "Organize Imports"

Click `Import` and browse to the folder. Pick the appropriate file. Make sure "Sponge" is selected as the style for all three.
